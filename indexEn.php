                            The specifications of the web development is based on three main parts : design, 
                            interactions, implementation.<br>
                            <br>
                            The design was completely free, the only obligation we had was to be able to see 
                            the difference between the two states of the game : light or darkness.<br>
                            It's Kael who realised the HTML and CSS implementation, he's behind the whole 
                            aspect of the website ; he wanted it to be perfect so he worked on it all project 
                            long !<br>
                            <br>
                            The web page respects the HTML5 format and includes HTML, CSS, and PHP only.<br>
                            <br>
                            <h2><i>Enter a whole world of lights.</i></h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class=\"txt\" id=\"jeu\"><img src=\"image/jeu.png\" alt=\"jeu\"/>
                            The game was entirely coded in PHP. Different interactions were necesseraly asked,
                            like being able to chose the size of the grid, to generate a random one, to post 
                            a victory message when the player wins...<br>
                            We decided to add minor interactions, as we wanted to do something creative and 
                            adjustable.<br>
                            <br>
                            This stage was realised jointly by each member of the team : Sixtyne made and 
                            posted the grid and its composants, Axel did the implementation of the game itself, 
                            and KaÃ«l thought about the visual incorporation of the game in the website.

                        <div class=\"txt\" id=\"maths\"><img src=\"image/maths.png\" alt=\"maths\"/>
                            Once we understood how the game works, we had to establish a mathematical model 
                            for the problem in order to elaborate a strategy and then an algorithm of 
                            resolution.<br>
                            <br>
                            By noticing that we want to find a combination which leads the grid in a particular 
                            configuration, we used our knowledge in linear algebra in order to transform the 
                            problem into an equation and so study the existence and uniqueness of the solutions.<br>
                            <br>
                            Mathematics made Sixtyne happiness, who worked on it quite a long time !<br>
                            <br>
                            Even if establishing a mathematical model of the game wasnât that hard to find, our 
                            teacher, Mrs Saini, put us on the right track of to find the solution.

                        <div class=\"txt\" id=\"code\"><img src=\"image/code.png\" alt=\"code\"/>
                            After having establish a mathematical model, we had to implement everything in the 
                            form of a solver in C language. Axel was the one in charge, and he had to turn 
                            things over in his head in order to release a good-looking program in time !<br>
                            <br>
                            He wrote all the essential fonctions required for the establishment of the gameâs
                            model and its mathematical resolution, under some technical constraints. The program 
                            takes a grid in input, and gives the list of the switches on which we have to click
                            to win the game. Moreover, a specific coding of the grid was defined in order to 
                            facilitate the use of the program in connection with the gameâs interactive web 
                            version.<br>
                            <br>
                            This stage relies mainly on the mathematical understanding of the problem.

                        }else{
                        echo "<div class=\"txt\" id=\"tck\"><img src=\"image/Tck.png\" alt=\"code\"/>
                            The last part of the project made us think about a variety of Lights Out : the 
                            Tacoyaki game. We had to transform the function governing the changing state of 
                            the discs (the algorithm of the game itself), as this time the diagonals change 
                            their state.<br>
                            <br>
                            The website was transformed as well. An ingenious implementation allows the 
                            user to switch games with a single button, and an extra variable links the CSS 
                            code to its game.

                                is able to find the solutions of the most complex equations !<br>
                                If weâre able to understand how the game works and resolve it 
                                effortlessly, itâs because of her.<br>
